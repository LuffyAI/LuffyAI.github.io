        <h1>Instructions: </h1> 
        <span>Please carefully read the examples of Motivational Interviewing (MI)-adherent and non-adherent responses below. 
        Your task is to model your response after the MI-adherent example, using the principles of empathy, open-ended questions, 
        affirming the client's strengths, and supporting their autonomy. 
        Avoid responses similar to the non-adherent example, which do not follow MI guidelines. Your goal is to help the client explore their feelings and motivations constructively.</span>

        <h3>MI-Adherent Example</h3>
        <div style="background-color: #e0f7e9; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;">
            <p><strong>Therapist:</strong> Tell me a little more about what you're feeling when your wife brings up her concerns about your weed use.</p>
            <p><strong>Client:</strong> Honestly, it's frustrating. I don't feel like it's that big of a deal, but she’s always on my back about it.</p>
            <p><strong>Therapist (MI-Adherent Response):</strong> It sounds like you’re feeling frustrated because you don’t see it as a major issue, but you’re also experiencing pressure from your wife to change. That’s a tough spot to be in. How do you feel about the idea of making changes, if at all?</p>
        </div>
    
        <!-- Non-Adherent Example -->
        <h3>Non-Adherent Example</h3>

            <p><strong>Therapist (Non-Adherent Response):</strong> Well, if she’s upset, then maybe it is a bigger problem than you realize. Have you tried stopping to make her happy?</p>
